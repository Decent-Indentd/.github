  <summary>Inspiration</summary>
the inspiration behind decent identd actually came from the idea of decentralizing email, and it has been growing steadily in my notion ever since then. The idea of all identities being centralized is a truely scary thought, as it means one breach will effectively comprimise everyone, but also goes deeper into the fact that the actual process for creating an idenity can be comprimised.
